# MonkeyPox

This project aims to provide a time series updated every hour about the 2022 Monkey Pox outbreak.

For now only global time series is available. /n
For now only confirmed cases are selected to build the time series "monkeypox_time_serie.csv".
All data come from Global.health.
"monkeypox_data.csv" is a csv file representing raw data of Global.health
Some graphs and some animations are generated from the time series

Feel free to use it in any way you want but please, please push for a world without this virus and without any of the other deadly diseases. 
"Living with the virus" is not a fatality it's a choice made for us.
